# Contributing

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible. All contributions
are welcome.

## Code of Conduct

The code of conduct is described in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs, enhancements and new feature requests. Please ensure that the
issue title is clear and concise. The detailed description or body should document what needs to be
done and why. Defects should include instructions for reproducing the issue.

## Issue References

GitHub issue numbers should be referenced on the last line of the commit message. Keywords can be
used to [automatically close
issues](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords). For example:

```
The Subject Line

A more detailed description that explains what the change is,
why it is needed, and how it has been implemented.

Closes #123, #456
```

## Commit Messages

"Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't avoid it completely, so our
efforts should go to reducing it \[as much\] as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as
a result, a *commit message shows whether a developer is a good collaborator*." -- Peter Hutterer

The seven rules of a great git commit message:

1. separate subject from body with a blank line;
2. limit the subject line to 50 characters;
3. capitalise the subject line;
4. do not end the subject line with a period;
5. use the imperative mood in the subject line;
6. wrap the body at 72 characters;
7. use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_.
